<h1>The Best Movie for Julius</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Fast and Furious Saga</h3>
<p>I enjoy watching Fast and Furious due to the cars that they use in the movie and the because of the action pack that they produced</p>
<h3>Batman Trilogy by Christopher Nolan</h3>
<p>Batman is my most favorite character, this always reminds me of my childhood and this movie is such a good movie as it was directed well and was made<br> close to being a realistic rather than being fictional</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>one of my favorite just the way it was made and directed it has action and humors
